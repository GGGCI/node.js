# node.js
## How to compile
Generated server in the https://github.com/HubertTW/tfhe-police/tree/main project
Then put the server into the uploads folder (in the current directory)
```
```
cd node.js
mkdir uploads/
```
```
sudo apt install -y nodejs
sudo apt install npm
npm install
node TTC.js
```
Then CMakeLists.txt is a backup, you can ignore it~
